# TrafficLights
The TrafficLights project is a Windows Forms application that simulates a traffic light control system.

# Key Concept:
- Event-driven programming: User control raises events, form reacts.
- Custom user control for encapsulated logic.

# Features
- Traffic Light Simulation: The project provides a realistic simulation of a traffic light system, allowing you to visualize the behavior of a traffic light with three states: Red, Green, and Orange.
- Configurable Durations: You can easily configure the durations for each traffic light state. Adjust the timing to match your desired traffic flow or specific application requirements.
- Event Notifications: The project raises events to notify you when the traffic light transitions between states. You can subscribe to these events and take custom actions based on the traffic light state changes.
- User-Friendly Interface: The main form provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the traffic light control system. It allows you to start and stop the traffic light timer, providing control over the simulation.
